# Personal System Setup #

This repository tracks all of my user/system configurations, preferences, dotfiles, custom aliases, functions, scripts,
programs, etc. for my used Linux distributions.

Different distributions and their versions are represented by branches.  
For example, the branch `fedora-37` is specifically for Fedora Workstation 37.

To install (or uninstall) the files to their correct locations, the [`manage`](manage) script is used.  
This script will read the [`Instructions.cfg`](Instructions.cfg) files, which declare which files need to be installed
where.
